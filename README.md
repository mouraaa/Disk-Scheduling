# Disk-Scheduling
### CISC 3320 HW#4

Write a program the implements 3 of the following disk-scheduling algorithms: <br>
* FCFS <br>
* SSTF <br>
* SCAN <br>
* C-SCAN <br>
* LOOK <br>
* C-LOOK <br>

Assume you have a disk drive with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0-4,999. <br>
Using the given request numbers below, implement an API that will use three of the algorithms listed above. The program will use track 100 as your starting track and for any algorithm where a direction is required, the direction is upward. It shall report the total amount of head movement by each algorithm.
