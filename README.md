# Disk-Scheduling
### CISC 3320 HW#4

Write a program the implements the following disk-scheduling algorithms: <br>
* FCFS <br>
* SSTF <br>
* SCAN <br>
* C-SCAN <br>
* LOOK <br>
* C-LOOK <br>

## PLEASE READ
_Assume that the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 199_

_You can change the order, number and request numbers by changing the numbers in the requests array at the top of the code to fit your specific problem._

_You can also change the max value through the max_value int at the top of the code. However, if you want to change the minimum value, you would have to go through the code and change it manually in each of the appropriate algoithims._ <br>

## Possible Updates:
* Ask user for starting head
* Ask user for request inputs
* Ask user for a direction
* Ask user for a specific algorithim
